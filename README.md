lab 1 for csc436 web applications class
There were two parts to this homework:
Part 1 was a simple html review exercise where we had to link a bootstrap styling sheet to see if it worked and we were able to do it.
Part 2 were some javascript exercises to review the weird quirks in the language. This would also help see if we had enough fundamentals to fully
understand and get into Reactjs in future assignments.
