            Hello! I'm in my last few courses for my MS in Computer Science too. I have relative experience with HTML, CSS, React,
            and Bootstrap (and Node) thanks to some internships, but I'd like to learn more in depth on how the logic works in React
            instead of learning on the fly. Hopefully this will improve my React overall. I'm interested in learning a bit more
            backend because I've mostly done frontend. It'll be cool to know more about how they work with each other. A class group
            chat would be beneficial more in Discord.
        </p>
